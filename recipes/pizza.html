    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)</li>
        <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour warm water into a bowl and sprinkle with yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add the water and yeast mixture. Use a spoon to mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 3 equal portions and place in lightly oiled bowls. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 550°F (or the highest setting). On a floured surface, stretch each portion of dough into a large circle. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
